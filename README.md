Hi, my name is sparky, or Aaron by birth. This page is my professional github where I post projects related to work and the services
that I offer. Some are example projects and eventually I hope to showcase some projects I've done for clients.

Expect to find _finished_ (neat) versions of programs on my github.com/thcsparky page here. Chaos becomes knit into uniformity here.. At least that's the goal. 

Thanks, Enjoy your stay!
